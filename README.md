# ImdbAPI-Reactjs

A super simple Reactjs app that uses IMDP api to get data.

Check the demo of the app here: https://rezaavoor.github.io/ImdbAPI-Reactjs/.


## Instructions

First clone this repository.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Rezaavoor/ImdbAPI-Reactjs.git
```

Install dependencies. Make sure you already have [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your system.
```bash
$ npm install react-scripts # or yarn
```

Run it
```bash
$ 
$ npm start # or yarn start
```

## CORS policy error while fetching.

In order to get rid of the CORS policy I have used a third-party provider that gives me the ability to fetch data.
In case it no longer works you can try other providers or install a Chrome/Firefox plugin that do this locally on your browser for you.
