      "What can be said that hasn\u0027t already been said about this show? Quite frankly, it\u0027s the greatest TV series ever created. Movie quality acting, set design, storytelling, cinematography, costumes....the one knock is in some of the early episodes CGI not being up to par (dragons mostly).\n\nThe show is brilliant in almost every way. Never before have I been as surprised by the outcome and been along for an unpredictable ride of what happens and what is to come.\n\nMy previous all time favorite show was Breaking Bad and there\u0027s a wide gap between GOT and pretty much anything else already out there. The word epic is thrown around too often these days as are 10\u0027s for anything that\u0027s halfway decent. GOT is as worthy as anything else being labeled as epic and deserves a 10 in an imperfect grading system.",
